## Section 1: The Hook (2 minutes)

### Opening Statement

> "Zana, you mentioned in our last call that your clients struggle with managing multiple CRM systems and wish they had better coaching for their SDRs. What if I showed you a tool that could cut research time by 80%, coach SDRs in real-time during calls, and plug directly into whatever CRM they're already using?"

### The Problem (30 seconds)

> "The typical SDR spends 40-50% of their day on research and admin - not selling. That's expensive labor doing Google searches instead of booking meetings."

### The Promise (30 seconds)

> "Lead Intel is an AI layer that sits on top of any sales stack. It does the research instantly, coaches during calls, and gives managers visibility - all in one interface. And the best part? You can white-label this and offer it to your clients as part of BSA's value proposition."

### Transition

> "Let me show you exactly how this works. I'm going to walk through a typical SDR's morning."

---

## Section 2: Instant Value - Lead Research (5 minutes)

### Setup
- Open the Leads page showing a queue of companies
- Pick a recognizable target company (ideally one Zana mentioned)

### Demo Script

> "Here's our lead queue. Let's say an SDR just got assigned this lead - [Company Name]. They need to call in 5 minutes. In the old world, they'd spend 20-30 minutes researching. Watch what happens now..."

**Action:** Click "Research" button on a lead

> "In about 30 seconds, the AI is going to pull from their website, LinkedIn, news sources, and social media to build a complete intelligence dossier."

**While loading, explain:**

> "This isn't just scraping data - it's synthesizing insights. Pain points, recent news, who the decision makers are, and most importantly - why they should care about what we're selling."

**When results appear:**

> "Look at this. We now have:
> - **Company overview** with key facts
> - **Pain signals** based on recent news and job postings
> - **Contact intelligence** from LinkedIn
> - **Custom talk track** tailored to THIS company
> - **Discovery questions** to open the conversation
> - **Objection handles** ready to go
>
> This took 30 seconds. Not 30 minutes."

### Key Highlight

> "See this fit score? 87%. The AI has already qualified this lead against your ideal customer profile. Your SDRs spend time on the RIGHT leads, not just any leads."

### Transition

> "Now let's see what happens when they actually pick up the phone..."

---

## Section 3: Live Magic - Call Coaching (7 minutes)

### Setup
- Open the Coaching page or Softphone
- Have a sample call transcript or recording ready
- Alternatively, do a live simulation

### Option A: Live Simulation Demo

> "I'm going to simulate a call. Watch the right side of the screen - that's where the AI coaching appears in real-time."

**Action:** Start a call (or play a recording with transcript)

> "As the conversation progresses, the AI listens and provides coaching tips. It's like having a senior sales manager whispering in your ear."

**Point out coaching tips as they appear:**

> "See that? The prospect just mentioned [pain point]. The AI immediately suggests a follow-up question to dig deeper."
>
> "And here - the prospect raised a common objection. The AI has a handle ready based on what works for this industry."

### Option B: Recorded Call Analysis

> "Let me show you a call from earlier today. Watch how the AI analyzed the conversation in real-time."

**Action:** Play recorded call with visible coaching tips

> "Notice how the coaching adapts. Early in the call, it's focused on discovery. As they get into objections, the tips shift to handling concerns. And when it's time to close, it prompts for the ask."

### Key Highlight - The 7-Dimensional Scoring

> "After every call, we score it on 7 dimensions:
> 1. Opening & rapport
> 2. Discovery depth
> 3. Value articulation
> 4. Objection handling
> 5. Next step secured
> 6. Talk ratio (were they listening?)
> 7. Overall effectiveness
>
> This isn't subjective - it's consistent coaching at scale."

### Zana Connection

> "Remember you mentioned the coaching element was particularly interesting? This is it. Every call, every SDR, gets expert-level coaching. Even your newest hires sound like veterans."

### Transition

> "Now let's flip to what a manager sees..."

---

## Section 4: Manager View (4 minutes)

### Setup
- Switch to Manager Dashboard
- Show team overview with metrics

### Demo Script

> "Zana, you've grown from 90 to 400+ agents. Imagine your clients' sales managers trying to keep track of their team. This is what they see."

**Action:** Open Manager Dashboard

> "At a glance, I can see:
> - Which SDRs are performing well
> - Who needs coaching
> - Team-wide trends over time
> - Call quality distribution"

### Drill Down

**Action:** Click on an individual SDR

> "Let me click on this SDR. I can see their last 10 calls, average scores, and specific areas for improvement."
>
> "See here? Their discovery score is lagging. As a manager, I know exactly what to coach on in our next 1:1."

### AI Insights

> "The AI even generates manager insights - like 'Team average talk ratio is too high this week. Consider a listening skills session.'"

### Key Highlight

> "This is visibility that doesn't exist in most sales orgs. Managers spend less time guessing and more time coaching effectively."

---

## Section 5: White-Label Opportunity (3 minutes)

### Setup
- Show branding configuration or mockup

### Demo Script

> "Now here's where it gets interesting for BSA. Everything you just saw can be white-labeled."

**Action:** Show branding options or describe

> "Imagine this:
> - **Your logo** on the landing page
> - **Your colors** throughout the interface
> - **BSA Solutions** as the trusted provider
>
> You offer this to your clients as a 'Sales Intelligence & Coaching Platform' - powered by BSA."

### Business Model Options

> "You could offer this as:
> 1. **Add-on to existing SDR services** - Increase value per seat
> 2. **Standalone SaaS offering** - New revenue stream
> 3. **Premium tier differentiator** - Win deals against other BPOs
>
> Your SDR teams get better results. Your clients see the improvement. BSA becomes indispensable."

### The Plug-and-Play Promise

> "Remember when you mentioned wanting 'plug-and-play sales generation' for your clients? This is it. They bring the leads, you bring the platform and the talent. Everything works together."

---

## Section 6: Next Steps (3 minutes)

### Summary

> "To recap what you just saw:
> 1. **30-second lead research** - Eliminates the biggest time waste
> 2. **Real-time call coaching** - Every SDR performs like your best
> 3. **Manager visibility** - Scale coaching without scaling managers
> 4. **White-label ready** - BSA can own this as a product"

### Open Discussion

> "What questions do you have? What would make this most valuable for your clients?"

**Listen and respond to:**
- Specific client use cases
- Integration requirements
- Pricing questions
- Implementation timeline

### Proposed Next Steps

> "Based on our discussion today, here's what I'd suggest:
>
> 1. **You send us 2-3 target companies** your clients typically call on - we'll build realistic demo data
> 2. **We schedule a deeper dive** with your business process and analytics teams
> 3. **We explore a pilot** with one of your existing clients
>
> Does that sound like a good path forward?"

### Close

> "Thank you for your time today, Zana. I'm excited about the potential here - BSA adding an AI layer to your already strong talent offering could be a real differentiator in your market."

## Handling Common Questions

### "How does this integrate with existing CRMs?"

> "We have native integration with Salesforce, and we're adding HubSpot, Pipedrive, and Zoho. The platform syncs leads bidirectionally - research and call data flows back to the CRM automatically."

### "What about data security?"

> "All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We're SOC 2 compliant. For enterprise clients, we can discuss on-premise deployment options."

### "How long to implement?"

> "Basic setup is same-day. CRM integrations take 1-2 weeks. Full training and rollout typically 2-4 weeks depending on team size."

### "What's the pricing model?"

> "We offer per-seat pricing with volume discounts. For a white-label partner like BSA, we'd structure it so you have margin to offer this profitably. Let's discuss specifics offline."

### "Can SDRs work in any language?"

> "The platform supports multiple languages. For your Malaysia market, we can configure for Malay, Chinese, and English. The coaching adapts to the language of the conversation."
