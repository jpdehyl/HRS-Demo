# Lead Intel

## AI-Powered Sales Intelligence & Coaching

*Transforming how sales teams research, call, and close*

---

# The Problem

### SDRs spend 40-50% of their time researching

**Not selling.**

- 30-45 minutes per lead just gathering information
- Calls are hit-or-miss without proper prep
- No help when objections come up mid-call
- Managers have no visibility into what's happening

---

# The Cost of Poor Preparation

| Without Prep | With Prep |
|-------------|-----------|
| Lower conversion rates | **2-3x higher conversion** |
| Fumbled objections | Confident responses |
| Generic pitches | Tailored conversations |
| Wasted AE time | Ready-to-close leads |

**Every unprepared call is a missed opportunity.**

---

# Introducing Lead Intel

### One platform. Three superpowers.

1. **AI Research** — 30 seconds, not 30 minutes
2. **Real-Time Coaching** — Help during every call
3. **Manager Intelligence** — Complete visibility

---

# Superpower #1: AI Research

## From 30 minutes to 30 seconds

Click one button. Get everything:

- Company intelligence & market position
- Decision-maker profile & background
- Pain points specific to their industry
- Tailored talking points & opening lines
- Discovery questions ready to ask
- Objection predictions with handling scripts
- Product recommendations with match scores

---

# Research That's Actually Useful

### Before Lead Intel:
*"Let me just check their LinkedIn..."*
(30 minutes later, still reading)

### With Lead Intel:
*"The AI found they're expanding to 3 new locations, struggling with their current CAD software, and the contact was just promoted to VP. I have 5 discovery questions ready."*

**Your SDRs spend time selling, not Googling.**

---

# Superpower #2: Real-Time Coaching

## Like having a sales coach on every call

- Live transcription shows the conversation
- AI generates coaching tips as the call happens
- Objection handlers appear when needed
- Research packet displays alongside the call
- Talk-time tracking keeps it balanced

---

# Coaching When It Matters

### Old Way:
Manager reviews call recording 3 days later.
Gives feedback in weekly 1:1.
SDR has already made 50 more calls.

### Lead Intel Way:
AI coaches during the call.
Tips appear in real-time.
Every call is an opportunity to improve.

**Real-time coaching > Post-mortem feedback**

---

# Superpower #3: Manager Intelligence

## Know exactly what's happening

### 7-Dimension Call Scoring:
1. Opening Quality
2. Discovery Skills
3. Active Listening
4. Objection Handling
5. Value Proposition
6. Closing Technique
7. Compliance

**Every call. Automatically analyzed. Objectively scored.**

---

# Manager Dashboard

- **Real-time metrics** — pipeline, conversion, calls
- **SDR leaderboard** — who's crushing it
- **ROI tracking** — prep vs. no prep conversion
- **Action items** — what needs attention now
- **Trend analysis** — spot issues early
- **Automatic reports** — no more spreadsheet Fridays

---

# The Handoff Problem

### What Usually Happens:
SDR sends Slack: *"Hey, qualified lead: Acme Corp, talked to John, seems interested"*

AE: *"What did you discuss? What's their budget? Timeline?"*

SDR: *"Umm... let me check my notes..."*

### Context = Lost

---

# Perfect Handoffs

### With Lead Intel:

One click generates complete handoff package:
- Full AI research packet
- All call recordings & transcripts

**AE picks up exactly where SDR left off.**
