**Your Complete Guide to Selling Lead Intel**

*Last Updated: January 12, 2026*

## What You're Selling

Lead Intel is an **AI-Powered Sales Intelligence & Coaching Platform** that transforms how sales teams work. Think of it as giving every SDR a personal research assistant and real-time coach, while giving managers complete visibility into team performance.

**The One-Liner:** *"Lead Intel eliminates research busywork and coaches SDRs during every call—improving conversion rates by 2-3x while saving 30+ minutes per lead."*

---

## The Problem We Solve

### For SDRs (Sales Development Reps)
- **40-50% of their time** goes to researching leads instead of selling
- Calls are hit-or-miss without proper preparation
- No real-time help when objections come up
- Manual note-taking during calls is distracting

### For Sales Managers
- No visibility into what's actually happening on calls
- Manual call reviews take hours (and only cover a fraction of calls)
- Weekly reports require tedious data gathering
- Hard to identify who needs coaching and on what

### For Account Executives
- Leads arrive with incomplete context
- Time wasted re-qualifying already-qualified leads
- No visibility into the SDR conversation history
- Have to start discovery over from scratch

---

## How Lead Intel Solves It

### 1. AI-Powered Research (30 seconds vs. 30 minutes)

**Before Lead Intel:**
- SDR opens LinkedIn, company website, Google News, Twitter
- Manually reads through pages of content
- Takes notes on potential talking points
- Tries to figure out what products might fit
- **Time: 30-45 minutes per lead**

**With Lead Intel:**
- SDR clicks "Research Lead"
- AI analyzes 4+ sources simultaneously
- Generates complete intelligence packet:
  - Company overview and market position
  - Decision-maker profile and background
  - Pain points specific to their industry
  - Talking points and opening lines
  - Discovery questions tailored to this prospect
  - Objection predictions with handling scripts
  - Product recommendations with match scores
- **Time: Under 60 seconds**

**Sellable Point:** *"Your SDRs spend their time selling, not Googling."*

---

### 2. Real-Time Call Coaching

**Before Lead Intel:**
- SDR makes the call, hopes for the best
- Fumbles when unexpected objections arise
- Manager finds out about issues days later (if at all)
- Coaching happens in weekly 1:1s (too late to help)

**With Lead Intel:**
- Research packet displays alongside the call
- Live transcription shows the conversation as it happens
- AI generates coaching tips in real-time based on what's being said
- Objection handlers appear when prospect pushes back
- Talk-time tracking ensures balanced conversations

**Sellable Point:** *"Like having a sales coach whispering in their ear during every call."*

---

### 3. Automatic Post-Call Analysis

**Before Lead Intel:**
- Manager manually listens to call recordings (when they have time)
- Subjective feedback based on memory
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria across the team
- SDRs wait days for feedback

**With Lead Intel:**
- Every call is automatically analyzed by Claude AI
- 7-dimension scoring provides consistent evaluation:
  1. Opening Quality
  2. Discovery Skills
  3. Active Listening
  4. Objection Handling
  5. Value Proposition Delivery
  6. Closing Technique
  7. Compliance
- Specific, actionable improvement suggestions
- Analysis available within minutes of call completion

**Sellable Point:** *"Every call gets reviewed. Every SDR gets coached."*

---

### 4. Manager Dashboard & Analytics

**Before Lead Intel:**
- Spreadsheets and manual tracking
- Weekly reports take hours to compile
- Performance issues discovered too late
- No way to compare SDR performance objectively

**With Lead Intel:**
- Real-time dashboard shows:
  - Pipeline value and conversion rates
  - Calls, meetings, and qualified leads
  - SDR leaderboard with rankings
  - ROI comparison (calls with prep vs. without)
- Automatic weekly/monthly reports
- Trend analysis identifies coaching opportunities
- 7-dimension scoring enables objective comparison

**Sellable Point:** *"Manage by data, not gut feel."*

---

### 5. Seamless Handoffs to AEs

**Before Lead Intel:**
- SDR sends a Slack message or email
- Context gets lost in translation
- AE has to re-discover what SDR already learned
- No record of the qualification conversation

**With Lead Intel:**
- One-click qualification with BANT capture
- Complete handoff package includes:
  - Full research packet
  - All call recordings and transcripts
  - AI analysis and scoring
  - SDR notes and recommendations
- Salesforce Task created automatically
- AE can pick up exactly where SDR left off

**Sellable Point:** *"AEs receive fully-prepped leads, not just names."*

---

## Key Integrations

### Salesforce CRM
- **Bi-directional sync**: Import leads, push updates back
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure enterprise authentication
- **Task creation**: Handoffs appear directly in Salesforce
- **Status tracking**: Lead lifecycle syncs automatically

*Pitch angle: "Works with your existing Salesforce—no rip-and-replace."*

### Zoom Phone

## The Numbers That Matter

### Time Savings
| Activity | Before | After | Savings |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Lead research | 30-45 min | < 1 min | 30+ min/lead |
| Call review (manager) | 15-30 min | 0 min (auto) | Hours/week |
| Weekly reporting | 2-3 hours | 0 (automated) | 2-3 hours/week |
| Handoff preparation | 10-15 min | < 1 min | 10+ min/lead |

### Performance Improvement
- **2-3x better conversion rate** with pre-call research
- **100% of calls analyzed** (vs. ~10% manual review)
- **Real-time coaching** on every call (vs. weekly 1:1s)
- **Complete context transfer** on handoffs (vs. partial)

### ROI Visibility
Lead Intel shows the conversion rate comparison directly in the dashboard:
- Calls WITH pre-call intelligence: **X%** conversion
- Calls WITHOUT pre-call intelligence: **Y%** conversion
- **Impact multiplier**: Clearly visible (typically 2-3x)

*Pitch angle: "You don't have to trust us—the numbers prove themselves."*

## Objection Handling

### "We already have Salesforce/CRM."
*"Perfect—Lead Intel makes Salesforce better. It syncs bi-directionally, creates tasks automatically, and fills in all the context your CRM is missing. Think of it as the intelligence layer on top of your CRM."*

### "Our SDRs don't have time to learn new tools."
*"That's exactly why they need this. The interface is simple—click 'Research Lead,' make the call, and the AI handles everything else. Most SDRs are fully productive in less than a day."*

### "How do we know the AI is accurate?"
*"Two things: First, all AI insights are grounded in real data—we show you the sources. Second, every packet includes a confidence score so you know when to trust it vs. dig deeper. No hallucination."*

### "What about compliance/security?"
*"Enterprise-grade security: OAuth 2.0 for Salesforce, encrypted data at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and automatic compliance flagging in call analysis."*

### "What's the implementation timeline?"
*"Most teams are live in 2-4 weeks. We connect to Salesforce, set up Zoom Phone integration, import your product catalog, and train your team. Ongoing support included."*

### "We tried AI tools before and they didn't work."
*"The difference is execution. We use Claude Opus 4.5—the most capable AI model available—for research, and we ground everything in real data. Plus, the real-time coaching means SDRs get value immediately on every call."*
