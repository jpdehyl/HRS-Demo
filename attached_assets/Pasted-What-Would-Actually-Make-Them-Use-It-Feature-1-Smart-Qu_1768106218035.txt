What Would Actually Make Them Use It
Feature 1: "Smart Queue"
Auto-prioritized list that updates in real-time:

Best time to call (timezone + historical pickup rates)
Leads that just took an action (visited website, opened email)
Expiring opportunities (follow-up date is today)
Feature 2: One-Click Calling
Click "Call Now" → Twilio dials → Research pops up during ring → They're talking with cheat sheet visible

Feature 3: Chrome Extension
Pop research overlay when they're in Salesforce/LinkedIn without leaving the page

Feature 4: Voice-First Design
"Alexa, pull up my next call"
"Show me pain points"
"Copy opener"

Feature 5: Manager Accountability
Don't just track usage - show results:

"Team members using call prep: 40% higher connect rate"
Make it competitive but not punitive
💡 Quick Wins (Implement These First)
Week 1:

Add "Call Queue" to dashboard - Top 10 leads to call today, sorted by priority
Auto-generate research - Remove "Generate Dossier" button
Add one-click dial - Call button triggers Twilio immediately
Week 2:

Create "Speed Brief" view - Condensed call prep (opener + pain + ask only)
Add success tracking - Show personal conversion stats
Mobile-optimize call prep - Responsive design for phones
Week 3:

Integration with their CRM - Auto-import leads from Salesforce/HubSpot
Remove duplicate features - If it exists in their CRM, don't rebuild it
Add ROI proof - Show correlation between usage and results
🎬 The Real Question
Instead of "Is this beautiful?" → Ask "Does this save them 30+ minutes per day?"

If using this app takes MORE time than their current workflow, they won't use it. Period.

The accordion design is gorgeous, but an SDR making 60 calls/day needs a cheat sheet, not a dossier.

What to change RIGHT NOW:

Replace current dashboard with auto-prioritized call queue
Add "Speed Brief" toggle to call prep (show ONLY opener, top pain, the ask)
Auto-dial integration (one click from queue to on-call)
Remove Kanban board (it's duplicate work)
Add personal ROI tracking
Make it stupid simple and stupid fast. That's how you get adoption.
