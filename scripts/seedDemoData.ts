    `${contactName}: Actually, yes. We've been struggling with ${painPoint}. It's been causing delays in our operations.
${sdrName}: I hear that a lot from operations leaders. Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you're facing?
${contactName}: Well, our current team is stretched thin, and we're finding it hard to scale during peak periods.
${sdrName}: That's a common issue. How many support agents or back-office staff do you currently have?
${contactName}: We have about 45 people across customer support and operations. The hiring and training costs have become a nightmare.`,
    `${contactName}: Yes, actually. We're evaluating different outsourcing solutions right now.
${sdrName}: Perfect timing then. What's driving the evaluation?
${contactName}: Mainly ${painPoint}. Our current in-house team just can't keep up with demand.
${sdrName}: I understand. What specific capabilities are you looking for in an outsourcing partner?
${contactName}: Quality talent, definitely. And we need 24/7 coverage with good English skills.`,
    `${contactName}: We're actually working with another BPO, but I'm always interested in learning about alternatives.
${sdrName}: I appreciate that. How is that relationship working out?
${contactName}: It's okay, but there are some quality issues. We might be open to a change.

${contactName}: Better talent quality and more flexibility. Our ${painPoint} is really hurting our customer satisfaction scores.`,

${contactName}: That would be significant for us. What would be the next steps?
${sdrName}: I'd recommend a discovery call where our solutions team evaluates your specific operational needs. Would that be valuable?
${contactName}: Yes, let's do that. I can also loop in our VP of Operations and HR director.
${sdrName}: Perfect. I'll send over some preliminary information and set up a call with our team.`,
    "meeting-booked": `${sdrName}: Given your timeline and the challenges you've outlined, I think a personalized consultation would be really valuable. Our solutions team can show exactly how BSA Solutions handles ${painPoint}.
${contactName}: That sounds good. When can we schedule that?
${sdrName}: How does next Tuesday at 2 PM work for you? We can do a 45-minute session.
${contactName}: Let me check... yes, that works. Send me a calendar invite.
${sdrName}: Excellent! I'll include a brief agenda. Who else should I invite from your team?
${contactName}: Add our operations manager, Mike Stevens, and Sarah from HR.`,
    connected: `${sdrName}: I really appreciate you taking the time today, ${contactName}. It sounds like there's definitely some alignment here.
${contactName}: Yes, thanks for the call. Send me some information and I'll review it with my team.
${sdrName}: Absolutely. I'll send over a case study from a similar company in your industry. Can I follow up next week to see if you have questions?
${contactName}: Sure, early next week would be fine.`,

${sdrName}: I completely understand. Timing is everything. Would it be alright if I checked back in about 2 years as you approach renewal?
${contactName}: That's fine, but I can't promise we'll be interested.
${sdrName}: I appreciate your honesty. Things change, and we'll be here if you ever need alternatives.`,
